// A batch is emitted when one of the following conditions is met:
//   - The batch reaches the size of n items
//   - The time since the first item was added to the batch exceeds the timeout
//   - The input stream is closed

// This function never emits empty batches. To disable the timeout and emit batches only based on the size,
// set the timeout to -1. Setting the timeout to zero is not supported and will result in a panic
