# Mock API

A minimal mock API implementation used in runnable examples on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/destel/rill).

This package simulates common API patterns like:
- Single and bulk item fetching
- Pagination
- Network delay simulation
- Realistic error scenarios

The package is intentionally kept public to enable running and experimenting with examples in the Go Playground.
